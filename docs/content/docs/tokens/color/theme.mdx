description: Theme color tokens for semantic UI states
---

Theme tokens define the semantic colors used for different UI states and purposes. Each theme color (primary, secondary, info, success, warning, danger) includes background, fill, and text variants with hover and active states.

These tokens are used by components like buttons, alerts, and badges to convey meaning through color.
