title: What are tokens?
description: Introduction to design tokens in the Catalyst design system
---

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

## Why use tokens?

- **Consistency**: Tokens ensure visual consistency across all components and applications
- **Maintainability**: Change a token value once, and it updates everywhere
- **Theming**: Tokens make it easy to support multiple themes (light/dark, brand variations)
- **Communication**: Tokens provide a shared language between designers and developers

## Token categories

Catalyst includes the following token categories:

- **Color**: Base palette, UI colors, and theme colors
- **Size**: Spacing, border radius, font sizes, breakpoints, and modal widths
- **Font**: Font families, weights, and text decorations
- **Opacity**: Opacity values for various UI states
- **Time**: Transition durations and delays

## Using tokens

Tokens are available as CSS custom properties (variables) that you can use directly in your stylesheets:

```css
.my-element {
  background-color: var(--cat-bg);
  padding: var(--cat-spacing-m);
  border-radius: var(--cat-border-radius-m);
}
```

See the [Development](/docs/tokens/development) page for more details on how to use tokens in your projects.
